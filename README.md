# HF Blog: RapidFire AI × TRL Integration

Co-authored draft of the Hugging Face blog article on the [RapidFire AI × TRL integration](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/v0.25.0/rapidfire_integration). This repo holds the manuscript and figures for joint editing and review.

## Repo Structure

* `article.md` — the single source of truth for the post
* `images/` — figures and diagrams used in the post

## How We Collaborate

1. Create a feature branch: `feat/<topic>` (e.g., `feat/intro-rewrite`).
2. Edit only `article.md`; add/update figures in `images/`.
3. Open a PR with a short summary of changes.
4. Use PR comments for line-level feedback; resolve threads before merge.

## Style & Formatting

* Use Markdown; keep paragraphs short.
* Headings: `#`, `##`, `###` (avoid deeper than `####`).
* Prefer active voice and concrete examples.
* Image filenames: `yyyy-mm-dd-short-title.png`, referenced as `![alt text](images/filename.png)`.

## Publishing Checklist

* [ ] Spelling/grammar pass
* [ ] All links validated
* [ ] Image alt text added
* [ ] Metadata (title, author(s), date) confirmed
* [ ] Final draft approved by Hugging Face & RapidFire AI
